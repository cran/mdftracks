Description: 'MTrackJ' is an 'ImageJ' plugin for motion tracking and analysis (see 
    <https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/mtrackj/>). This package reads 
    and writes 'MTrackJ Data Files' ('.mdf', see 
    <https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/mtrackj/format/>). It supports
    2D data and read/writes cluster, point, and channel information. If desired, 
    generates track identifiers that are unique over the clusters.
    See the project page for more information and examples.
